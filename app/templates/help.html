    <h3>When to Seek Medical Attention</h3>

  <h2>Prevent Getting Sick</h2>
    <div>You can take steps to protect yourself and others during a COVID-19 outbreak.
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Recent studies indicate
          that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the
          spread of COVID-19.
      </li>
      <li>There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
      </li>
      <li>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</li>
    <ul>
    <h3>How COVID-19 Spreads</h3>
      <h4>1.Person-to-person spread</h4>
        <div>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
          <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.</li>
          <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>
          <li>Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>Maintaining good social distance (about 6 feet) is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19.</div>
      <h4>2.Spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects</h4>
        <div>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a
             surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their
             own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the
             virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus.
        </div>
        <div> Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available,
              use an alcohol-based hand rub. Also, routinely clean frequently touched surfaces.
        </div>

        <li>Do NOT use a facemask meant for a healthcare worker.</li>
        <li>Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others.
            The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing.

      <ul>
        <li>If you are in a private setting and do not have on your cloth face covering,

            doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards,
            toilets, faucets, and sinks.
        </li>
        <li>If surfaces are dirty, clean them. Use detergent or soap and water prior to
            disinfection.
        </li>
        <li>Then, use a household disinfectant. Most common EPA-registered household
